# book-your-book

This project was made for Hackathon event in ABV-IIITM Gwalior.

This is about a peer to peer book sharing website in which people in a college use their web mail account to login.
They can lend and borrow books from their peers who they might not even know. This is made keeping in mind the situation
of lack of particular books during exam times and also for book readers.

Add the database file in any php server and run the php files from the same server to gain access to the project.
