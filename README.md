# book-your-book

This project was made for Hackathon event in ABV-IIITM Gwalior.

This is about a peer to peer book sharing website in which people in a college use their web mail account to login.
They can lend and borrow books from their peers who they might not even know. This is made keeping in mind the situation
of lack of particular books during exam times and also for book readers.

To run the website:
Download any php server, I used xampp.
create a database called dbslab and import the database file into it.
run the localhost server and open index.php.

Hope you liked my project.
